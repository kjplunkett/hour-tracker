# Hour Tracker
> simple timesheet app

## Purpose:
- To use all of the little things I am learning
- Practical application to submiting hours bi-weekly

## Technologies:
- Yeoman (copying file structure, but not using template or terminal command)
- Node (npm init, http-server)
- Grunt (plugins: Sass, Watch)
- Sass (SCSS)
- Git 
- Backbone (Model, View, Collection, jQuery, Underscore)
- Polymer Elements (Core, Paper)
- Bower Package Manager

## Next Step:
- Make it actually work by plugging in the back end...
- Save all the hour info in a database
- Give other users access to that info

fun stuff :)
